# Advent of Code Challenge

## Overview
Welcome to my repository for the Advent of Code challenge! This is a series of daily programming puzzles spanning a variety of skill sets and challenge levels, designed to improve my coding skills and problem-solving capabilities.

## About Advent of Code
Advent of Code is an annual event where participants are given a set of programming puzzles to solve every day from December 1st until Christmas. Each puzzle grants a star upon completion, and the goal is to collect all 50 stars by December 25th.

## Goals
- Enhance my problem-solving skills in a fun and challenging way.
- Improve my proficiency in C++ and Python (I am currently learning about C++).
- Share my solutions and learnings with the community.

## Structure
Each day's challenge is stored in a separate folder named 'Day-X,' where 'X' is the day of the challenge. Each folder contains:
- The problem description for the day.
- My solution code.
- A brief write-up explaining my approach.

## Progress
- Day 1: Trebuchet?!
- Day 2: Cube Conundrum
- Day 3: In progress

## Running the Solutions
To run any solutions, navigate to the respective day's folder and follow the instructions provided in the folder's README.
